## Implementation of a Song Lyrics Fetcher


In this repository you can find a file named ```lyrics.py``` that implements the ```get_lyric( artist, title)``` function. It queries the [lyrics.ovh](https://lyricsovh.docs.apiary.io/#) website to fetch the lyrics of a song ```title``` by the specified ```artist```.
If you run the program, executing the main file with: ```python main.py``` it will give you results similar to the following: 

```
$ python main.py
Across the Universe by Beatles:
Words are flowing out like 
Endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.
Pools of sorrow waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me.
...
```

Note that the project requires the ```json``` and ```requests``` modules to run.
